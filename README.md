# 🎬 MovieLens 1M – Matrix Factorization for Recommendation Systems

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a collaborative filtering recommendation system using **matrix factorization techniques** on the [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/). The system predicts user ratings for movies based on learned latent features.

## 🚀 Key Objectives

- Load and preprocess large-scale movie rating data.
- Analyze rating patterns and data distributions.
- Build a matrix factorization model using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- Train the model with gradient descent optimization.
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE and visualize results.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** MovieLens 1M
- **Description:** Includes 1 million ratings from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies.
- **File Used:** `ratings.dat` containing `UserID`, `MovieID`, `Rating`, and `Timestamp`.

## 📈 Results

- Extracted latent user and movie features via SVD.
- Achieved meaningful predictions of user preferences.
- Demonstrated the power of collaborative filtering in real-world recommendation systems.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with matrix factorization and optimization techniques.
- Improved understanding of recommender system architecture.
- Practical knowledge of evaluating predictive models in Python.
