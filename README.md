üìò Project Title: MovieLens 1M ‚Äì Matrix Factorization for Recommendation Systems
üîç Description
This project involves building a movie recommendation system using matrix factorization techniques on the MovieLens 1M dataset. The primary objective was to implement and evaluate a collaborative filtering approach using latent factor models, specifically Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to predict user ratings and recommend movies effectively.

üß† Key Features
Data Processing: Loaded and explored ratings.dat from the MovieLens 1M dataset using pandas to extract user, movie, rating, and timestamp information.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Identified patterns in user behavior and rating distributions, and analyzed dataset dimensions including unique users and movies.

Matrix Factorization: Built a recommendation model using matrix factorization (with gradient descent optimization), decomposing the user-item interaction matrix.

Model Evaluation: Assessed the model using metrics like RMSE and visualized the prediction performance.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
